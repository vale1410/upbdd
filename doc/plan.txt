today: 

next: 
[] Makefile debugging. why is he rebuilding everything everytime? dont understand...

unordered: 
* find out about global bddOne and impOne. simplify some case analysis!
* do the andBdd cache!
* split into several files: imp, upbdd, backend, test, inout, 
* sort vector of ints nicely
* search stage 1: simple left first search, bitset with implications, bitset with decision, simple step, no feedback
* search start 2: with feedback, n steps, rest BDD, as result
* bddAND with rest (BREAK)
* conjunction of initBdds smarter: if variable all the same -> conjunct

done:
[done] read DIMACS files into class Problem containing vector<Clause>. use boost::tokenizer, boost::lexical_cast
[done] : impliedLevel
[done] : makeNewImpWithBit / in impStore
[done] : finish bddAnd, test suite
[done] : adjustLevel ( in impStore )
[done] finish impliedLevel, and makeNewWithBit!
[done] make a first simple test!
[done] plane: impSubtraction. for that you can check if not exists already for bitest
[done] first day: add(Bdd) finished
[done] : test add(Bdd)
[done] : bddAnd ... (simple,with rest)
