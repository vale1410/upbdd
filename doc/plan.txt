next:                                                                                   
[] make implication from "typedef vector<int> RawImplication".
[] new tests with this ftypedef facilities of DIMACS files. rewrite the old tests, will make the list much shorter!
[] Makefile debugging. why is he rebuilding everything everytime? dont understand...

unordered: 
* clean up namespaces: using namespace std; in common, remove in all buffers std::
* find out about global bddOne and impOne. simplify some case analysis!
* do the andBdd cache!
* sort vector of ints nicely
* search stage 1: simple left first search, bitset with implications, bitset with decision, simple step, no feedback
* search start 2: with feedback, n steps, rest BDD, as result
* bddAND with BREAK
* conjunction of initBdds smarter: if variable all the same -> conjunct. group of variables, init step

done:
[done] read DIMACS files into class Problem containing vector<Clause>. use boost::tokenizer, boost::lexical_cast
[done] impliedLevel
[done] makeNewImpWithBit / in impStore
[done] finish bddAnd, test suite
[done] adjustLevel ( in impStore )
[done] finish impliedLevel, and makeNewWithBit!
[done] make a first simple test!
[done] plane: impSubtraction. for that you can check if not exists already for bitest
[done] first day: add(Bdd) finished
[done] test add(Bdd)
[done] bddAnd ... (simple,with rest)
