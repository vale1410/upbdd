next days: 
[done] plane: impSubtraction. for that you can check if not exists already for bitest
[done] first day: add(Bdd) finished
[] : test add(Bdd)
[] : bddAnd ... (simple,with rest)
[] : finish bddAnd, test suite

unordered: 
* split into several files: imp, upbdd, backend, test, inout, 
* read DIMACS files into vector<vector<int>>
* sort vector of ints nicely
* ints to upbdds
* search stage 1: simple left first search, bitset with implications, bitset with decision, simple step, no feedback
* search start 2: with feedback, n steps, rest BDD, as result
* bddAND with rest
* conjunction of initBdds smarter: if variable all the same -> conjunct
