here some ideas: 

which key value map to use?
* first shot: boost::unordered_map -> easily replaceable with others after
* tommyD
* trie 
* google spares hashmap

garbage collection: 
* first use boost::shared_prt, overhead ulong (64bit)
* maybe later: boost::intrusive_ptr is the right thing to use?

for testing:
* memory leaks: http://valgrind.org/info/about.html
